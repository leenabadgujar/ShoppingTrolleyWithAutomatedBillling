# Shopping Trolley With Automated Billling System
A cart that contains a Rfid reader whenever the product attacted with RFID Tags when scanned as the item is added to the cart and automatically bill is created. Have used microcontroller Atmega16, RFID Tags, and LCD 20x4 to display the name of the product,  total price and expiry details.We have also added 2 buttons on cart 1st for deleting any item and another for final payment.
Programed the microcontroller using AVR studio software.
